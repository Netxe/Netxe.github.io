# What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

<br>
Open Graph is a technology that was first introduced by facebook in 2010. It works by integrating Open Graph meta tags into a webpage content, it allows me to identify which elements on my page i want to show when someone is sharing my page.

Below follows my meta tags that I've putten in the head element of my webpages.

{% highlight ruby %}
  <meta property="og:title" content="Open Graph" />
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="http://netxe.github.io/" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="/assets/open-graph.png" />
{% endhighlight %}
