# What do you think of static site generators?
- What type of projects are they suitable for?

<br>

I think static site generators are effective in some 
circumstances. The possitive aspect of it i think is the few steps required, there is no repetition and not too much indirection. The markdown language lets us avoid tasks where we usually have to repeat HTML,(lists and menus etc). 

In my opinion and why i have gotten a good impression by this type of generator is because by using a filesystem to store all contents, it allows me to store my workplace in a single location.<br>

However so it seems that static site generators are not good for high-traffic, though it is suitable for low-traffic, this fabolous blog for example.
