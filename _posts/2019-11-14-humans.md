# What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

<br>
The purpose of the humans.txt file is to inform others about the people who have contributed to building the website. At the moment there is no standard on how it should be written.


I used [http://humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/) as a template for the structure of the file.

Below is my humans.txt file
