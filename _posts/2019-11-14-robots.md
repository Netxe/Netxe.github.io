# What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
<br>

The owner of a website can use the /robots.txt file to give certain instructions about their site to web robots. Basically, the robots.txt document tells the web robots which kind of information that they are allowed to access on the website. However this configuration can still be bypassed by malicious bots.

Below follows my configuration of the /robots.txt file, which tells by the first line it's applied to all bots followed by blocking all information.

{% highlight ruby %}
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
{% endhighlight %}
