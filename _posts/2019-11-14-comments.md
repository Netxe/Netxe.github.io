# How did you implements comments to blog posts?

I subscribed and created an account at [disqus.com](http://www.disqus.com). Since minimina are already providing the necessary structure I do not have to do much, I changed the configuration in _config.yml file to my disqus shortname, below follows an example of how my code are looking.

{% highlight ruby %}
disqus: 
    shortname: jj223pz
{% endhighlight %}
